# Human Emotion Detection

This project aims to detect human emotions from images using deep learning techniques.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Tensorflow 2.0 or higher
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- keras

### Installing
``` 
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install keras
pip install tensorflow
```

Clone the repository to your local machine


### Usage
To train the model, run the following command
```python TrainEmotionDetector.ipynb ```

To test the model, run the following command
```python TestEmotionDetector.ipynb ```



## Built With

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - The deep learning library used
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) - Image processing library
* [keras](https://keras.io/) - Keras is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks.
